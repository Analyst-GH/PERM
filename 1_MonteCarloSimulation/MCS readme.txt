**A Monte Carlo Simulation**

Original programs in STATA accompanying
``Taking an extra moment to consider treatment effects on distributions´´ by Gawain Heckley and Dennis Petrie


The STATA files are:
"Monte Carlo_ME_IPW_BS11_DP_GHV2.do" -- the STATA file that performs MCS, comparing PERM regression and IPW analysis of the mean, variance, skewness and standardised skewness, stores the PERM and IPW estimates, and their bootstrapped standard errors for each replication and sample size as a datafile.

"Monte Carlo coverage BS11 figuresGH.do" and "Monte Carlo coverage BS11ln figuresGH.do" -- the STATA files that combine the replications to provide the MCS output as figures
Results from these programs are displayed in Figure 1 and Figure 2, and Figures G.1-4 in Appendix G.

"Monte Carlo_distrFigures.do" -- the STATA file that combine the replications to provide Figure E.1

"Monte Carlo table Replication.do" -- the STATA file that combines the replications to provide the MCS output for table F.1

"Monte Carlo table BS11.do" -- the STATA file that combines the replications to provide the MCS output for table G.1
